`vlingo/schemata` allows for managing schemata for events and commands that
to be consumed by other bounded contexts, thus implementing the published language pattern.

`vlingo/schemata` can be run as standalone service and comes with a user interface
and an HTTP API that lets you manage master data, schemata and generate source code.
Using `vlingo-build-plugins`, you can also interact with schemata as part of your build process.

In projects, you'll typically consume and/or publish schemata to be able to integrate
with other bounded contexts in a type safe and versioned manner.

In this example, you'll see how to ...

* ... build an run `vlingo/schemata`
* ... manage schemata and schemata meta data using the UI and the HTTP API.
* ... push schemata to the registry from maven builds and
* ... consume schemata stored in the registry as part of the build.

For detailed information on the rationale and usage of `vlingo-schemtata`,
please refer to https://docs.vlingo.io/vlingo-schemata.

== Prerequisites

To be able to follow along, you'll need:

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.3.x
* A running instance of `vlingo/schemata` (see <<Set up vlingo/schemata>>)
* Some master data (see <<Provision schemata master data>>)

=== Set up vlingo/schemata

The easiest way to get started is to use the `vlingo/vlingo-schemata` docker image:
`docker run -eVLINGO_ENV=dev -p9019:9019 vlingo/vlingo-schemata`.
This will expose the application on `:9019` using an in-memory DB for persistence.

If you want to build it yourself, clone https://github.com/vlingo/vlingo-schemata
and refer to https://github.com/vlingo/vlingo-schemata#build for further instructions
footnote:[`mvn package -Pfrontend` on JDK8 does the trick. Thats about it, instruction-wise, actually.].

NOTE: For further configuration options like connecting to a persistent DB, see https://hub.docker.com/r/vlingo/vlingo-schemata.

=== Provision schemata master data

To be able to integrate your projects with the schema registry, you need to
make your organization structure and available published languages known first.
You can do this either via the HTTP API or the UI.

Schemata are structured in a hierarchical manner:
`Organisation -> Units -> Contexts -> Schemas -> Schema Versions`.
We'll push new schema versions using the maven plugin.
Before running the build, you need to have at least one of each other entity prepared.

==== Using the UI

From the navigation drawer to the left, open the editor for each of these entities and create one.
The build assumes the following structure:

* Organisation: `Vlingo`
** Unit: `examples`
***** Context Namepace: `io.vlingo.examples.schemata`
****** Schema: `SchemaDefined`
****** Schema: `SchemaPublished`

.Create context using the UI

.The result should look like this

==== Using the API

In case you are using IntelliJ, you can just run the requests in `masterdata.http` directly;
`masterdata.sh` is a bash script doing the same
footnote:[Requires `curl` and `jq` on the path and `VLINGO_SCHEMATA_PORT` to be set, e.g. `VLINGO_SCHEMATA_PORT=9019 ./masterdata.sh].
Otherwise, deriving the `wget` footnote:[`PostMan`, `HTTPie`, `Insomnia`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, pick your poison.]
calls from the snippets should be a simple exercise.

== Run

Now that we have the master data in place, we can publish some schemata from
`vlingo-schemata-producer`. The schema sources live in `src/main/vlingo/schemata`
in that project. To publish them, simply run `mvn install` in the project root.
The build output should contain <<output-producer>>, the UI should display the created schemata as shown in <<ui-schema-version>>.
You can also have a look at the generated code (`Specification -> Source`) and description using the
and the generated description (`Description -> Preview`)


Next, hop over to `vlingo-schemata-consumer` and open `SchemataUsageTest` in your IDE.
You'll notice that it does not compile, as the schema class is missing.
Now run `mvn generate-sources` and verify that the code generated from schemata is
pulled and written to `target/generated-sources/vlingo` as shown in <<output-consumer>>.
The test relying on schemata sources will now compile and execute as expected,
verify this by running `mvn test`.

NOTE: This is just for illustration purposes. Typically, you'll rely on maven's default lifecycle binding
 and not call `generate-sources` explicitly. Simply running `mvn install` will determine
 that `vlingo-build-plugin` is bound to `generate-sources` and run it before compilation.


Note that in the build output, you see two warning messages indicating that the status of the schemata
used is `Draft`. You can go through the schemas lifecycle using the UI as highlighted in <<ui-schema-version-lifecycle>>.
Alternatively, you can change the status using the API by `PATCHing` against http://localhost:9019/organizations/<orgId>/units/<unitId>/contexts/<contextId>/schemas/<schemaId>/versions/<schemaVersionId>/status.

Now, publish one of the schemata and re-run the consumer build. You'll notice the warning no longer shows up.
Then deprecate the schema, and re-build again. You'll see a warning again.
After setting the state to removed, your consumer build will fail, see <<output-consumer-removed-schema>>. Try that as well.

`vlingo/schemata` also provides a safety net to prevent you from publishing incompatible versions by
accident, so you won't break consumers of your published versions.
To see what happens in this case, open the `SchemaDefined.vss` specification and make some incompatible changes,
e.g. by changing a type, reordering some fields and changing field names:

.incompatible update to SchemaDefined see src/main/vlingo/schemata/SchemaDefined2
```
event SchemaDefined {
    long occurredOn
    version v
    type t
}
```

In the producer project's pom, remove the second schema from the list of
schemas to push and reference the updated file as a new patch version.

.refer to the updated schema in the POM
```
<schema>
  <ref>Vlingo:examples:io.vlingo.examples.schemata:SchemaDefined:0.0.2</ref> <1>
  <src>SchemaDefined2.vss</src> <2>
  <previousVersion>0.0.1</previousVersion> <3>
</schema>
```
<1> updated reference to new version
<2> use updated specification; this would normally be the same file
<3> specify the version the update is applied to

You'll notice that the build fails and presents you with a list of changes you have made.
Now you can either change the update to make it compatible or update the version to the next
major version `1.0.0`.

So, by using the schema registry you not only have a way to integrate multiple bounded contexts
but are - as a consumer - safe from inadvertent upstream incompatibilities and, - as a publisher -
safe from accidentally pushing such updates.

If you've tried this via the UI, you would have seen a detailed <<ui-incompatible-diff>> as shown below.
