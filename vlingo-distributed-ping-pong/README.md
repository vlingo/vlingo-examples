# distributed-ping-pong

A simple example to demo vlingo/lattice Grid features, running on a three nodes vlingo/cluster.

To test the example, run `mvn clean compile` from the root of the project.

Then, start three terminal windows and run one of the following commands in each.

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="node1"
```
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="node2"
```
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="node3"
```

You may want to configure the ports for the communication channels between the nodes in the cluster in `src/main/resources/vlingo-cluster.properties`.

A successful run should output the similar logs as the following:

```
...
